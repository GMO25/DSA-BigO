// 1) Sheep one - proportional to input size so linear time O(n) - number of recursive calls
// 2) Power of - linear time O(n) as the higher the exponent the more recursive calls 
// 3) Reverse String - linear time O(n) as the longer the string the more recursive calls required
// 4) Triangular Number - linear time O(n) higher the triangular input number the more recursive calls required
// 5) String Splitter - Logarithmic time O(log(n)) due to the fact that only recursive calls are
// required for / characters and converting them into , commas - so dependant on specific input 
// 6) Fibonacci - Polynomial time O(n^k) - icreases in size of number (input) will result in
// number of recursive calls to some constant power - in this case 7 to the power of 1.37 
// 7) Factorial - Linear time O(n) size of input is directly proportional to number of recursive calls
// 8) Maze - Polynomial time O(n^k) - increases in size of maze result in number of recursive calls
// to some constant power - in small maze matrix of 9 it  would be approx 1.4
// 9) Anagrams - Exponential time O(2^n) - input size of 4 causes 24 operations so 2.3^n 
// 10) Organizer chart - Linear time O(n)
// 11) Binary - Logarithmic time O (log(n)) - input size is cut in half /2.
