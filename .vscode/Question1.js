// 1)Could argue a larger crowd of 30 (input size) you may have to shout twice 
// but the shouts needed are not the same as the input size so its Logarithmic 
// O(log n)

// 2)Each person is an input so the amount of calls is proportional to the amount of people
// It would be LinearTime O(n) - take longer for more inputs
